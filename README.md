## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **Gameplay**
**Q: How do I save my progress?** A: Your progress (High Score, Level, and Points) is saved automatically to the cloud whenever you complete a year or make a decision. Ensure you are signed in (via Apple, Google, or Facebook) to sync your data.

**Q: I ran out of Political Capital! How do I get more?** A: You earn Political Capital (Points) by surviving years in office. The better your approval ratings and economy, the more Capital you bank at the end of each year.
